          <h2>and future software developer</h2>
          <p>I am a precision machine designer with a long international career and four spoken languages. I am also a future software developer. The orientation and emphasis are currently under investigation. Will I become a front end, backend or full stack developer? Or maybe .NET is my thing? Should I concentrate on big data and cloud services? You can influence the decision!</p>
          <p>I've used scripts and programming languages often in my work. MATLAB for kinematic calculations, test data analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. LabVIEW for measurement and position control software. LaTeX for scientific writing. SQL queries to read parameters from and write data to MS Access databases. Even VBScript for an autonomy calculator of a remotely controlled inspection train. I know how machines think and how humans think. I just need to study the tools that are needed to bring these worlds together in a meaningful and efficient way!</p>

            <h3>Compact Linear Collider (CLIC)</h3>
            <p>Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a study of a 3 TeV linear electron-positron (e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup>) accelerator and it is a successor candidate for CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC). CLIC has a very ambitious luminosity target is, which causes unprecedented pre-alignment requirements of its main linear accelerator (main linac). I worked on the pre-alignment of main beam quadrupole magnets which focus the particle beam. An article that I've written can be read <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1350/1/012137">here</a>.</p>

            <p>My research was on active pre-alignment of a future particle accelerator called <a href="https://clic.cern/">CLIC</a> (Compact Linear Collider). More specifically, I was developing the positioning system of CLIC main beam quadrupole magnets. Positioning of single magnets is done using a parallel kinematic system based on eccentric cam movers. The requirement was that the cam mover can position both ends of the magnet to within 1 μm from target in vertical and lateral directions simultaneously. After positioning, the system’s stiffness had to be maximised passively.</p>
            <p>Key contributions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improved the state of the art of cam movers. The accuracy target will be reached with minor improvements while system fundamental frequency was improved from 15 Hz to 44 Hz.</li>
              <li>Was in charge of and mostly executed myself the whole cam mover design process. Mechanical design, control system (including HW and SW), ordering parts, assemblying prototype, running and analysing tests, reporting and presenting the results to the academic community.</li>
              <li>Participated in the development of the latest motion control software and supervised a student who did his M.Sc. thesis on the update.</li>
